    I just recently finished my bachelor's degree as a Computer Engineering student 
    at Chiang Mai University. I'm usually a leader/initiator when working on a group's project.
    And I also believe in "can do" attitude if the problem is not proven to be impossible.
    I love to build a robust software to solve people's problems.
