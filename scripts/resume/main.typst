    = Work Experiences
    == LINE MAN Wongnai (08/2024 - Present) 
    *Software Engineer (Mostly Backend)* 
    - I worked on merging two backend services by implementing database migration tools, 
      moving endpoints to one service, conducting regression tests, fixing existing bugs, 
      and performing some refactoring. 
      I believe I played a significant role in ensuring we met the deadline for this project.
    - I improved the developer experience by enhancing the CI pipeline speed and enabling LSP 
      to work in a pure JavaScript repository.
    - I rewrote one service to make it much cleaner and more maintainable by changing the code 
      structure and adding unit tests.
    == Amity Technologies (05/2023 - 10/2023)
    #set par(justify: true)
    *Backend Developer Intern* 
    - I developed a new feature using Moleculer (a JavaScript microservice framework), 
      along with AWS, MongoDB, Redis, Kubernetes, and other relevant technologies.
    - I addressed technical debt by updating dependencies, improving unit test coverage, 
      and fixing flaky test cases.
    - Additionally, I conducted a knowledge-sharing session and resolved various bugs.

    == Fuzzy Technical Indicator (2023 - 2024)
    My bachelor's final project on how we can improve the effectiveness of various technical indicators 
    in trading by using fuzzy logic, particle swarm optimization and other statistical methods. 
    I'm involved in developing Backend using MongoDB and Actix on Rust with various optimizations 
    such as multithreading, caching. Also, Iâ€™m involved in developing the Frontend by using SvelteKit too.

    IEEEXtreme is a global challenge in which teams of IEEE Student members compete in a 24-hour 
    time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems. I joined this event
    with my friends and got the 877th world ranking and 1st in Thailand ranking.

    == 4th place team of Kibo RPC (2022)
    I write a java program to make the Astrobee robot do designated tasks on the ISS
