Yey, finally have time for some blog writing. So recently I have joined [LINE MAN Wongnai](https://lmwn.com/) 
and now it's a time for yearly self-review so I thought I should do it along with this blog!

## How's work so far?
So I started working with LINE MAN Wongnai on August, it has been around 4 months of officially working
as a full time software engineer, mostly backend things. So what am I doing in the past 4 months?

<br>

Mostly dealing with technical depts, fixing bugs and write some database migration tools, actually 
I have not developed a new feature yet since I started working lol. But my team should finished this 
project by the end of this year (I really hope we finished it). So what's the problems?

<br>

I will simplify it in one phrase "merging shits together, so we can actually maintain them".

## What Have I learned?
So the codes is written in PHP, Javascript, Go, and some Java. I definitely have gotten better 
at writing PHP code, pure JS with JSDoc and Go too. I also have a chance to check out some of their 
internal tools which are useful but I think somewhat lacking in the documentation, I occasionally 
have to look at the code to understand what is going on but I think it's acceptable.

Postgres is nice though, but the current DB schema is kinda werid.
